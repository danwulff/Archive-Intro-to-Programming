    <p>I've had a lot of tough jobs in the past, but this is one of my big successes!  I was able to take this sad excuse of an "office",
     make it into something absolutely stunning!  what can I say, the results speak for themselves.</p>

       <p>Mittens is a sweet girl that was given up due to her owner no longer able to take care
       of her.  But, that hasn't changed how much love she gives those who will give her a scratch
       behind the ears!  Give this sweet old girl a home, and she will share her heart with you for many
       years to come.
